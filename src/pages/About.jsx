            Hi, I'm Thomas Westfall—a Frontend Web Developer on a journey to master full stack development, 
            a 2D/3D pixel artist, and a former singer/songwriter who now crafts instrumental soundscapes 
            for video games using Ableton. Currently unemployed but far from idle, I'm dedicating every day 
            to growing my skills as a developer and artist, transforming my passion into expertise.

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '28px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>My Journey</h2>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            My path to development has been anything but conventional. I've invested countless hours in 
            learning through Udemy courses (with certificates to show for it), and I'm currently over halfway 
            through the Full Stack Web Development program at Codex Academy. But my creative journey began 
            long before code entered my life.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            For five years, I worked in music, pouring my heart into songwriting and 
            performance. Over the past few years, I've explored the intricate world of pixel art, creating 
            2D and 3D assets that bring games to life. I've also spent over 3 years crafting an entire universe from scratch with a story that's straight from the soul. These experiences taught me more than technical 
            skills—they taught me discipline, creativity under pressure, and the power of perseverance.

        <section style={{ marginBottom: '40px' }}>
          <h2 style={{ fontSize: '28px', marginBottom: '15px' }}>What Drives Me</h2>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            I'm passionate about inspiring people who struggle with Depression and PTSD—helping them see 
            the beauty in the breaking. I believe that pain can either make or break us, and I've chosen 
            to let mine make me stronger. Through my work, I want to inspire others to do the same, to 
            transform their struggles into fuel for positive change in the world.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            What sets me apart is my mental stamina and relentless drive. When I dive into a project, 
            I get completely lost in the work, producing at a rapid rate without sacrificing quality. 
            Whether it's code, art, or music, I approach everything with the same intensity and dedication.
          </p>

          <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            One of my proudest achievements is <strong>Forgeon</strong>, a comprehensive video game planner 
            application that I spent two months developing from the ground up. This project showcases my 
            ability to take an idea from concept to completion, implementing features that solve real problems 
            for indie game developers and their teams. You can find Forgeon and other projects in my portfolio.

          <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            When I'm not coding or creating art, you'll find me immersed in video games—particularly pixel 
            art masterpieces like Octopath Traveler and the older Final Fantasy titles. These games aren't 
            just entertainment; they're inspiration, showcasing what's possible when art, storytelling, and 
            technology converge.

          <p style={{ fontSize: '18px', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            I'm here for anyone and everyone. Whether you're a company looking to hire someone who delivers 
            quality, an indie game developer seeking assets or development help, or a team member needing 
            collaboration—I've got something to offer. I genuinely love helping people, and I bring that 
            passion to every interaction and project.
